# README 05-StinkyPotatoes

Start Date-8/5/17 End Date-8/8/17

**Purpose:** To practice Ruby on Rails skills and maintain knowledge.

**Methods:** This was an on-line tutorial available through Youtube.

**Ref:** Child, M. "How To Build a Movie Review App in Rails 4".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DR5JLZ2Qgg&index=5&list=PL23ZvcdS3XPLNdRYB_QyomQsShx59tpc-. Oct 4, 2014.

**Results:** Good tutorial overall. The main gems used are as follows:
* Devise-         User registration
* Paperclip-      Adding images
* Bootstrap-sass- Basic clean styling
* Jquery-rails-   Adding Rails functionality
* Searchkick-     Adding search feature in navbar

* Raty.js-        Adding star rating system



I probably could have finished this a little bit earlier but had a few things come up. Pretty good tutorial overall. Going through each of these particular tutorials is helping me solidify the processes of setting up users, setting up gems, using jquery within rails, and just getting me used to using Rails.

**Blocks:** The main block was getting Searchkick/Elasticsearch set up. The video went was conducted on a Mac, not Linux. I had to figure out how to set up Elasticsearch and that opened a whole new level of knowledge. I was actually able to figure it out despite not having clear instructions from the internet. It was pretty interesting and I'm pretty sure I didn't do it completely right because I have a whole directory of the code downloaded from Elasticsearch in the app. I imagine there is a better way of doing something like this.


**Lessons:** The main lesson is configuring Elasticsearch, that was a good exercise in general. I stumbled upon it in a good way. That alone was really good. In general, as mentioned, getting used to writing thing differently in each part of the app and connecting the various routes is becoming clear.
